# PDF_Read
# A code that allows the user to access a particular PDF file and allow the document to be read back to the user by extracting the text from page(s). Maily focused on the pypdf2 library which allows us to access the associated PDF file while the pyttsx3 library allows for the document to be read back to the user by extracting text/data from the file.
